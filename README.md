# can2mqtt
can2mqtt connects a CAN-Bus to an MQTT broker and vice versa. You create pairs of CAN-Bus IDs and MQTT topics and choose a conversion mode between them. 

Here you can see can2mqtt in action:

## Installation
can2mqtt is written in Go and static linked binaries are available [here](https://github.com/c3re/can2mqtt/releases/latest).
can2mqtt has no further dependencies. On a Raspberry for example it should be enough to run:
```
wget https://github.com/c3re/can2mqtt/releases/download/v2.2.0/can2mqtt-v2.2.0-linux-arm -O can2mqtt
chmod +x can2mqtt
./can2mqtt
```

## Usage
The commandline parameters are the following:
 ```
 ./can2mqtt -f <can2mqtt.csv> -c <can-interface> -m <mqtt-connectstring> [-v]
 ```
 
Where can2mqtt.csv is the file for the configuration of can and mqtt pairs, can-interface is a socket-can interface and mqtt-connectstring is string that is accepted by the eclipse paho mqtt client. An additional -v flag can be passed to get verbose debug output. Example:
```
./can2mqtt -f /etc/can2mqtt.csv -c can0 -m tcp://127.0.0.1:1883
```
## can2mqtt.csv
The file can2mqtt.csv has three columns. In the first column you need to specify the CAN-ID as a decimal number. In the second column you have to specify the convert-mode. You can find a list of available convert-modes below. In the last column you have to specify the MQTT-Topic. Each CAN-ID and each MQTT-Topic is allowed to appear only once in the whole file.

Example:
```
112,none,huette/all/a03/door/sensors/opened
113,2uint322ascii,huette/all/000/ccu/sensors/time
115,uint322ascii,huette/serverraum/000/filebitch/sensors/ftp_diskusage_percent
116,uint322ascii,huette/all/000/router/sensors/rx_bytes_s
117,uint322ascii,huette/all/000/router/sensors/tx_bytes_s
118,uint322ascii,huette/clubraum/000/ds18b20/sensors/temperatur
119,uint322ascii,huette/all/000/airmonitor/sensors/temp
120,uint322ascii,huette/all/000/airmonitor/sensors/hum
121,uint322ascii,huette/all/000/airmonitor/sensors/airq
122,uint322ascii,huette/all/000/airmonitor/sensors/pm2_5
123,uint322ascii,huette/all/000/airmonitor/sensors/pm10
```

Explanation for the 1st Line: For example our Doorstatus is published on the CAN-Bus every second with the CAN-ID 112 (decimal). can2mqtt will take everything that is published there and will push it through to mqtt-topic huette/all/a03/door/sensors/opened.

## convert-modes
Here they are:

| convertmode           | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `none`                | does not convert anything. It just takes a bunch of bytes and hands it over to the other side. If you want to send strings, this will be your choice. If you have a mqtt payload that is longer than eight bytes, only the first eight bytes will be send via CAN.       |
| `bytecolor2colorcode` | Converts an bytearray of 3 bytes to hexadecimal colorcode                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `pixelbin2ascii`      | This mode was designed to address colorized pixels. MQTT-wise you can insert a string like "<0-255> #RRGGBB" which will be converted to 4 byte on the CAN-BUS the first byte will be the number of the LED 0-255 and bytes 1, 2, 3 are the color of red, green and blue. |
| `16bool2ascii`        | Interprets two bytes can-wise and publishes them as 16 boolean values to mqtt                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Unidirectional Mode
Normally can2mqtt works in bidirectional mode, that means all messages von can are send to mqtt and vice versa. If you wish you can run can2mqtt in a unidirectional mode to only send messages from can to mqtt or only mqtt to can. To do so you have to use the flag `-d` with one fo the following settings:

| dirMode | effect                                                                          |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0       | bidirectional mode, messages will be send from can to mqtt and vice versa       |
| 1       | unidirectional mode, messages will only be send from CAN-Bus to mqtt broker     |
| 2       | unidirectional mode, messages will only be send from mqtt broker to the CAN-Bus |

## Add a convert-Mode

If you want to add a convert-Mode think about a name. This is the name that you can later refer to when you want to
use your convert-Mode in the `can2mqtt.csv` config-file. In this example the name of the new convert-Mode is `"mymode"`.
Next, add the new convert-Mode in the [switch-case block in `src/main.go`](./src/main.go#L247). In the new case
statement you refer to two functions. One is called when a MQTT-message is received and the other one when a CAN-frame is
received. Change the contents of those functions to the behaviour that you seek for. Mockup code for `MyModeToCan` and
`MyModeToMqtt` can be found in [mymode.go](./src/mymode.go). 

Good luck & happy hacking ✌
